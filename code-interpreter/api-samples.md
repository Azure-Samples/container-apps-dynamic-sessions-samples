# Overview

The Code Interpreter Dynamic Sessions currently support API versions `2024-02-02-preview`, `2024-08-02-preview`, and `2024-10-02-preview`. 

Beginning with version `2024-10-02-preview`, the API contract has undergone significant changes. If you are starting fresh, it is recommended to use the latest version, as earlier preview versions will be deprecated soon once a stable release is available.

For the Code Interpreter Dynamic Sessions pool, API responses are further enriched with additional information, such as headers indicating concurrent session execution details. This added information may not be present in Custom Container-based Dynamic Sessions, though the high-level structure remains similar.

You can also find the latest APIs Swagger definitions [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/tree/main/specification/app/data-plane/Microsoft.App.DynamicSessions)
