# Overview

The BYOC capability supports the same APIs as the built-in code interpreter-based dynamic sessions pool, detailed [here](../api-samples.md). Note, however, that some API versions may not be available for BYOC.

Please refer to these [guidelines](./changes-from-code-interpreter-to-custom-interpreter.md) for transitioning from local container image and testing setups to remote Dynamic Session Pool API executions.
